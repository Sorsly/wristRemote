for multidimensional arrays, arduino only wants column definition, not row definition. will throw error otherwise
	https://forum.arduino.cc/index.php?topic=220385.0

testing procedure
	arduino program requires sudo
	radios must be assigned distinct ids
	any test code requires the 4 header files:
		nRF24L01.h
		RF24_config.h
		RF24.cpp
		RF24.h

testing notes
	nRF24L01+ devices appear consistent most of the time, but the receiving end sometimes completely cuts out if slightly nudged. May have to do with the yellow uno, or it could be the transceiver itself, or maybe loose wires, etc.
	connection does not appear to be greatly affected by distance over a span of 3 feet or so
	trapping transceiver partially in altoid tin doesn't affect ping
